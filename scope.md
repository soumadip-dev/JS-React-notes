## JavaScript Pillars

JavaScript has four main pillars:

1. **Scopes**
2. **Coercion and Types**
3. **Async Programming**
4. **Objects and Classes**

#### Scopes in JavaScript
- Scopes determine where variables or functions are accessible in the code.
- JavaScript's scoping mechanism is different from other languages like Java, C++, and Python, so avoid mixing these concepts.

To fully understand scoping in JavaScript, it's essential to grasp the difference between compiled and interpreted languages:

- **Compiled Languages (e.g., C, C++):** Code is analysed and compiled into an executable binary by a compiler. Errors must be fixed before any code is executed.
- **Interpreted Languages (e.g., Bash):** Code is executed line by line. If an error occurs, execution stops at the error.
- **Hybrid Languages (e.g., Java, JavaScript, Python):** These languages use both compilation and interpretation for code execution.
